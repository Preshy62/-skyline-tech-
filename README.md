Table-2 contains a Table data containing Skyline ict students records.
what is contained in this project is what we call A Table data commonly called 'TD' <td>.
it is expedient to note that in between every Table data contains all the content of the table cells.
A table can contain different element for example image,email etc.
Each of the table row starts with <tr> and each of the table data has to be in the "tr".
Another important feature to consider in creating a table is the Table head <th> and they are usuallly build in default.
It is also pertinent to note that the table data is use to store important information or data.
